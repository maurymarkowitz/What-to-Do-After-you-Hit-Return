# What To Do After You Hit Return

"What to Do After you Hit Return" is a collection of computer games first published by the People's Computer Company (PCC) in 1975. The first version was written in HP-BASIC, for the then-popular HP2000 systems. This makes the source somewhat harder to convert to "modern vintage" systems based on MS-derived BASICs like those found on the Apple II or Commodore line. Many of these games would re-appear in MS-BASIC versions in the much more famous "101 BASIC Games" and "BASIC Computer Games".

These listings have been hand-converted from a [copy of the book on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Whattodoafteryouhitreturn). The listings are printed on a dot-matrix printer and the scanning quality is highly variable, so in some cases best-guesses have been made in the case of variable names and a few numeric constants.
